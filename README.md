# Arcade City Terminal
====================

The Arcade city terminal is the starting point of the user journey in Arcade City. 
The Arcade City Terminal will be the main entry screen into the Arcade City ecosystem and will be the switchboard towards all the Arcade City games ( starting with Ridesharing ).
It provides the Arcadians the possibility to create and and manage a basic profile and exchange ARC tokens in a wallet.

## New user
A new Arcadian opens the app and can create his own wallet in Arcade City. He must choose a strong password (min 9 characters) and needs to enter this twice. A new wallet is created. The new user needs to download the json file to store his encrypted private key and is asked to keep it safe, together with his password.

## Existing user
A user that already has a wallet in Arcade City, can upload his json file and enter his password, to import his existing wallet.

## Terminal 
On the main terminal screen, the user sees his avatar, username, balance, reference currency and an overview of all games provided in Arcade City (to start with ridesharing).

## Profile 
The user can go to the profile screen, to personalize his account.
The user can change his profile picture and username. The user can upload a file for profile picture, or take a picture with the camera in his device. The image can be cropped before saving.
A user can set the currency to which he wants the ARC tokens to refer to. The user can choose between BTC/ETH/USD/EUR. In the balance of the wallet, this reference currency will be shown, besides the ARC token balance.
On the profile screen, the user sees a history of all transactions he made.

## Wallet
By ckicking on the balance, the user goes to wallet screen, where he can send tokens to another user, by entering the amount and the shortcode of the receiver. Once the transaction is completed, the current status of that transaction is shown and gets updated untill done. 
The user can receive tokens by giving his shortcode to the person wanting to send tokens.
